					<h2>Project 1:  Process</h2>
					<p><img src=images/process.gif></p>
					<p> To create this avatar, I stuck very closely to the isometric grid. I began by constructing the basic block shapes that make up the head and torso of the avatar. As I moved along, I strayed from the grid to give my avatar a little more shape. I worked across multiple artboards to get a better visual of my work and to try different things. Finally, I scaled all of my final pieces to fit on a 2 inch tall artboard.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src=images/isoavatar.gif></p>
					<p> For this project I began by researching different isometric avatars. I really liked the ones that emphasized the square shapes and stuck to the isometric grid. I decided to use this idea and designed my avatar based on what I was wearing that day. By taking on this block like shape I was able to use the isometric grid to my advantage. Once the shapes were made I used different opacities to create a feeling of depth through shadows of colors. Finally, I added the fun element of a fire to complete the "summer night" version of my-avatar-self.
