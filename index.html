					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 3 Process</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon3process-01.png></p>
					<p> To construct this icon, and used the same process I did for icons 1 and 2. In the end, all 3 icons were created by placing a graphic over a teal circle with a thick black stroke. Each graphic used a gray fill with thin white, rounded strokes. These aspects helped to make all of the icons uniform and true to me.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 3</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon3-02.png></p>
					<p> For icon 3, I decided to use another object specific to me, a keychain that my mom gave me. The keychain is a hand that has bendable fingers, and everyone who knows me knows what my keys looks like. I chose to have the hand make the Shaka sign, as my brothers and I used to use the sign as a handshake when I was a kid. Additionally, I feel that this symbol shows my laid back personality, and even my love for the beach.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 2 Process</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon2process-01.png></p>
					<p> I worked on my icons by switching back and forth between ideas. For this icon I also played with gradients and colors as I had not finalized my design for the first icon. Ultimately, this icon had issues with gradients similar to icon 1, and I decided to get rid of them completely.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 2</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon2-02.png></p>
					<p> After finishing my first icon, my second icon came pretty easily. I decided to use the same color scheme, circular shape, and similar strokes for my second icon, which is my signature laid over a circle. I felt that this was a good icon for me as I have been using this signature to sign all of my art work since about 6th grade.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 1 Process</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon1process-01.png></p>
					<p> Once I had an idea for the first icon, I created some sketches. My first sketches combined my signature with a compass. However, this seemed too complex for an icon so I decided to separate these aspects into 2, giving me the idea for my second icon, which focuses on my artistic signature. Once my idea was simplified, I moved to the computer. I worked on the largest icon first. I used a gradient to make the compass hands pop more. However, when I moved to the smaller sizes I realized that this would not work well. I decided to play with the intensity of the gradient based on the size of the icon, with a heavy gradient in the largest icon to no gradient in the smallest icon. This was more effective than having the same gradient for all 3 sizes, but ultimately I decided just to lose the gradient completely for a simple and bold look.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icon 1</h2>
					<p><img class="icon" src=images/icon1-02.png></p>
					<p> I had a difficult time coming up with ideas for my icons at first as I wanted to come up with a concept that really showed people something about me. For the first icon I decided to represent the necklace that I wear everyday, a compass necklace. I like the compass as an icon because it represents how adventurous I am, and how much I like to travel; but also how I always return to my home, New York.

					<h2>Project 1:  Process</h2>
					<p><img src=images/process.gif></p>
					<p> To create this avatar, I stuck very closely to the isometric grid. I began by constructing the basic block shapes that make up the head and torso of the avatar. As I moved along, I strayed from the grid to give my avatar a little more shape. I worked across multiple artboards to get a better visual of my work and to try different things. Finally, I scaled all of my final pieces to fit on a 2 inch tall artboard.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src=images/isoavatar.gif></p>
					<p> For this project I began by researching different isometric avatars. I really liked the ones that emphasized the square shapes and stuck to the isometric grid. I decided to use this idea and designed my avatar based on what I was wearing that day. By taking on this block like shape I was able to use the isometric grid to my advantage. Once the shapes were made I used different opacities to create a feeling of depth through shadows of colors. Finally, I added the fun element of a fire to complete the "summer night" version of my-avatar-self.
